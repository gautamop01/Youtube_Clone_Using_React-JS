# Youtube_Clone_Using_React-JS
This application is a YouTube Clone built using React JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The primary functionality of this app is to enable users to browse and view videos. To accomplish this, the app fetches video data from an external API.

The app features a homepage that displays video cards, providing users with a visual preview and brief information about each video. These video cards serve as clickable links that direct users to a dedicated video player page when selected.

The video player page is designed to play the selected video and provides additional details about the platform where the video was created or uploaded. This information allows users to understand the source of the video content.

Several packages are utilized within the app to enhance its functionality. Axios, a popular JavaScript library, is used to make HTTP requests to the external API and retrieve video data efficiently. React-Intersection-Observer is employed to handle the intersection of elements in the user's viewport, facilitating better performance and optimizing the loading of video cards. React-Icons is utilized to incorporate various icons within the application, improving its visual appeal and user experience.
